In this project we used air quality data gathered from weather stations across the United States to analyze the effect that the wildfire season has on air quality.

We extended the scope of the project to determine what other factors contribute to the air quality index and found a high correlation between air quality and commuter traffic, which was in most cases higher than the effect from a wildfire season.

**ABSTRACT**

In the year of 2020 there were 4,304,379 acres burned in California during an especially dire wildfire season
(1). California is known to have a seasonal pattern of large scale wildfires in a multitude of counties across
the state. Despite the fact that California is one of the largest continental states, we seek to show that the
presence of such intense wildfires has a marked effect on the air quality index reported on a county basis.
In this report we will organize the data into a county by county basis and seek to determine the extent to
which the wildfire season effects air quality and if the difference is large when compared to other states in
the nation. We will then turn our attention to a subset of greenhouse gas emission data that was reported
in the dataset and create a linear regression model that can predict the air quality index given the daily
emissions of those gasses such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Finally we will compared
our models predictions over the state of California against predictions made for other states that do not have
a perennial wildfire season and contrast the accuracy of our model in both cases.
